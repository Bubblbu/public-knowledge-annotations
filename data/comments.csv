However, I think that this could be the intended effect of spreading so-called fake news. The public may more easily dismiss careless bullshit instead of something more sinister.

apuBWLecEeiG0jNjMxJUig,2,cypriine,"The difficulty for me is that the author's definition is so broad, and as the others have commented, a little bit of a stretch. I am leaning more towards the latter of your interpretation, but I can not decisively say that his speech is made entirely in the name of self-preservation. If I understand this correctly, later, the author goes on to imply that the orator perhaps believes in his words less than what they are meant to convey about him to his audience. This is an interesting point, just not one I am sure if I can agree with. ",2018-09-13 21:31:46.585462,2018-09-13 21:31:46.585462,['u24ifrcbEeiA2b9TEMY3ZA'],True
QLSMvrebEeiVn-dA2Dk7qA,2,cypriine,"Yes, I agree that perception makes it a little difficult to discern a clear definition here. Certainly the orator is being nationalistic, but I think the key is that he is hyperbolic. The hyperbole could be considered as short of a lie , which then could neatly be considered 'humbug' by Black's definition. Of course, it would be ignorant not to acknowledge that the speech being considered humbug is entirely dependent on the audience's perspective, and their kind of truth.",2018-09-13 21:23:26.767645,2018-09-13 21:23:26.767645,"['sJL_5rUnEei8Hmf7qKYVbA', 'qi3tyra_EeiZKh8I41JXXA']",True

lTJt5LcrEeiU92tssTtHcg,2,michelle_la,"I don't buy this. I don't think most people have the time to be thinking about the nature of their reality or be solipsistic. It is a rather privileged position to be in to be able to spend one's time pondering about the social construction of reality.

The author also fails to provide examples of what he means as ""anti-realist"" doctrines. So I am just speaking on my interpretation of his writing.

In practice, perhaps what the author is talking about are those who believe in ""alternative facts"" are anti-realists. I think it takes a lot of time, education, intellectual engagement to b able to triangulate data, and be media literate -- i.e. privileged, in order to really have an 'objective' view on the world. While the author does state that objectivity may never be achieved but its a goal, he fails to consider what type of society/culture, education system, values, institutions, resources are needed to create a democracy of ""informed"" citizens. 

I think for many people in the world their sense of reality is based on patterns they see, socialization,  personal experiences, in addition to appeals of authority, etc, So I think we should be more understanding of where and why anti-realist doctrines come from in social life",2018-09-13 08:04:04.876247,2018-09-13 08:04:04.876247,,True

I think there is an 'art' to good story telling, and with the realties of timing and resource constraints that researchers have -- I am sure its the same with policy makers -- it may not always be feasible, and you need a person/people on your team who can help do this. It's imperative to first have relevant, reliable, valid data.

Because of that, there is an important decision on *how* to present the information (creeping on the edge of persuasion?). I have no clue what the balance is in trying to be as objective as possible (and if that's even possible/what objectivity would look like in all contexts) and framing it in an interpretable way for the target audience.

( ie in order to understand the whole, break it down into its constituent parts ) Bill Rees, Professor Emeritus, UBC, maintained that ""the objectification of the natural world is due to the Cartesian subject-object dualism"" and the concept of ""environment-as-separate entity"" has been invented by humans.  Because we perceive the environment as separate from ourselves, ""there is no compelling need to love,cherish, or even husband nature, to do anything beyond exploiting its bounty to our own advantage.""

From my perspective, we ultimately came to consensus that first and foremost governments fund research to accumulate capital and to stay competitive in our neoliberal globalized economy. Competitiveness can manifest in different ways, such as creating skilled labourers; supporting technological advances; having diversified markets; asserting dominance as a soft/hard power; having hegemony over knowledge; and long-term investment in having informed/skilled/healthy citizens.


I believe that given the political economic paradigm we're in, research a good funded ultimately for the government/state to remain relevant and competitive in our globalized economy. Does this trickle down to it really being a **common** good? No. I argue it becomes a good for those (individuals/institutions) who are privileged and have access to opportunity/resources.

As Kathy Woodward put it so brilliantly on Friday, the major crisis facing the funding of higher education is an increasingly widespread conviction that education is a private responsibility rather than a public good; we wind up strengthening that conviction when we treat our work as private, by keeping it to ourselves. Closing our work away from non-scholarly readers, and keeping our conversations private, might protect us from public criticism, but it can’t protect us from public apathy, a condition that is, in the current economy, far more dangerous.""*",2018-10-04 09:33:36.048051,2018-10-04 09:33:36.048051,"['lHfAwMVKEeidoPuskfj9RA', 'GAyMzMdiEei120_BDNBhBg']",False

The term altmetrics was proposed in 2010, as a generalization of article level metrics, and has its roots in the #altmetrics hashtag. Although altmetrics are often thought of as metrics about articles, they can be applied to people, journals, books, data sets, presentations, videos, source code repositories, web pages, etc. Altmetrics use public APIs across platforms to gather data with open scripts and algorithms. Altmetrics did not originally cover citation counts, but calculate scholar impact based on diverse online research output, such as social media, online news media, online reference managers and so on. It demonstrates both the impact and the detailed composition of the impact. Altmetrics could be applied to research filter, promotion and tenure dossiers, grant applications and for ranking newly-published articles in academic search engines.""

Green, hybrid or gold Open Access
Open Access is a form of scientific publishing in which information is made available to readers free of charge. There are two options:

Green Open Access – required at TU/e

The green way to Open Access publishing is to publish an article in a traditional subscription journal (not Open Access). After publication a version of the article is also placed in an Open Access institutional repository (open publication database).

This is called ‘self-archiving’ because publications are registered by authors themselves.

Authors from TU/e are requested to register all academic publications and to upload the final authors’ versions. You do not need to prepare your own publication for open access. The IEC will make your publication available through Green Open Access, if allowed by the publisher.

Supplying your publication to the TU/e Repository for open access

Gold Open Access

There are now two ways of gold open access publishing:

(Full) gold open access
In a gold open access journal all publications are freely accessible to readers immediately and without restrictions. In this open access model there are no subscriptions fees and publishers gain their income by charging authors (or their institutions) when articles are accepted. These charges are known as ‘article processing charges’ (APCs). This variant of open access is generally referred to as full gold open access or pure gold open access (to distinguish it from hybrid gold open access).


Hybrid (gold) open access
In this variant of gold open access authors publish in traditional subscription journals, but may offer gold open access to their articles by paying APCs. Open access is then offered to all readers immediately as articles appear on-line. Usually only part of articles in hybrid gold open access journals are actually made available in this way. Articles which are published in such journals but which are not available via gold open access cannot be viewed by readers who do not subscribe to those journals.

2. Each author has given consent to appear as an author. Each author will automatically receive notice of abstract submission, and will be able to view it at any time.

I'm pretty sure these are standard phrasing for conflict of interest, ethics, and protection of intellectual property, so it is not this particular conference I am commenting on, but the general attitude toward the different actors it describes, that is common to most such conferences.

Persons with ASD diagnoses are ""human subjects,"" protected from being damaged in the same way animal subjects are, but only researchers' / authors' knowledge and insights are valued. It is presumed, I suppose, that the human subjects had signed their rights away in their informed consent document before participating in the research, and therefore do not need to be considered. I wonder, though, if one can actually assume that everyone participating in social science research is truly and meaningfully ""informed"" of the way that their bodies and behaviors are transformed into someone else's property.

The Science Citation Index (SCI) is a citation index originally produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and created by Eugene Garfield. It was officially launched in 1964. It is now owned by Clarivate Analytics (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of Thomson Reuters).[1][2][3][4] The larger version (Science Citation Index Expanded) covers more than 8,500 notable and significant journals, across 150 disciplines, from 1900 to the present. These are alternatively described as the world's leading journals of science and technology, because of a rigorous selection process.[5][6][7]

The index is made available online through different platforms, such as the Web of Science[8][9] and SciSearch.[10] (There are also CD and printed editions, covering a smaller number of journals). This database allows a researcher to identify which later articles have cited any particular earlier article, or have cited the articles of any particular author, or have been cited most frequently. Thomson Reuters also markets several subsets of this database, termed ""Specialty Citation Indexes"",[11] such as the Neuroscience Citation Index[12] and the Chemistry Citation Index.[13]",2018-11-08 00:30:47.196040,2018-11-08 00:30:47.196040,,False
