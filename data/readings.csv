Something I was thinking about from the lecture last week: In terms of sharing research, won't there always be a certain \""framing,\"" whether that's (for example) the title of an article in a scientific journal, or a conference presentation, or a news story, or a Facebook post? The decision on how to frame something seems to me inherent in *any* way that any information is shared, and can potentially affect how it is interpreted, and how it's used as evidence. Because of that, there is an important decision on *how* to present the information (creeping on the edge of persuasion?). I have no clue what the balance is in trying to be as objective as possible (and if that's even possible/what objectivity would look like in all contexts) and framing it in an interpretable way for the target audience. Ultimately I think that how anything is presented will frame the work in some way, and that framing will have implications for its persuasiveness. I would hope, however, that whatever decision is made is as close to the \""objective truth\"" as possible, but I can see that it doesn't always happen that way.

Competitiveness can manifest in different ways, such as creating skilled labourers; supporting technological advances; having diversified markets; asserting dominance as a soft/hard power; having hegemony over knowledge; and long-term investment in having informed/skilled/healthy citizens.\n\n\nI believe that given the political economic paradigm we're in, research a good funded ultimately for the government/state to remain relevant and competitive in our globalized economy. Does this trickle down to it really being a **common** good? No. I argue it becomes a good for those (individuals/institutions) who are privileged and have access to opportunity/resources.

There are two options:\n\nGreen Open Access \u2013 required at TU/e\n\nThe green way to Open Access publishing is to publish an article in a traditional subscription journal (not Open Access). After publication a version of the article is also placed in an Open Access institutional repository (open publication database).\n\nThis is called \u2018self-archiving\u2019 because publications are registered by authors themselves.\n\nAuthors from TU/e are requested to register all academic publications and to upload the final authors\u2019 versions. You do not need to prepare your own publication for open access. The IEC will make your publication available through Green Open Access, if allowed by the publisher.\n\nSupplying your publication to the TU/e Repository for open access\n\nGold Open Access\n\nThere are now two ways of gold open access publishing:\n\n(Full) gold open access\nIn a gold open access journal all publications are freely accessible to readers immediately and without restrictions. In this open access model there are no subscriptions fees and publishers gain their income by charging authors (or their institutions) when articles are accepted. These charges are known as \u2018article processing charges\u2019 (APCs). This variant of open access is generally referred to as full gold open access or pure gold open access (to distinguish it from hybrid gold open access).\n\n\nHybrid (gold) open access\nIn this variant of gold open access authors publish in traditional subscription journals, but may offer gold open access to their articles by paying APCs. Open access is then offered to all readers immediately as articles appear on-line. Usually only part of articles in hybrid gold open access journals are actually made available in this way. Articles which are published in such journals but which are not available via gold open access cannot be viewed by readers who do not subscribe to those journals. \n"", ""uri"": ""https://peerj.com/articles/4375/"", ""flagged"": false, ""tags"": [], ""updated"": ""2018-10-30T23:45:35.292475+00:00"", ""hidden"": false, ""group"": ""__world__"", ""id"": ""5bmRTNydEeimBOeAHerIDA""}, {""permissions"": {""read"": [""group:__world__""], ""update"": [""acct:michelle_la@hypothes.is""], ""delete"": [""acct:michelle_la@hypothes.is""], ""admin"": [""acct:michelle_la@hypothes.is""]}, ""user"": ""acct:michelle_la@hypothes.is"", ""user_info"": {""display_name"": ""Michelle""}, ""document"": {""title"": [""The state of OA: a large-scale analysis of the prevalence and impact of Open Access articles""]}, ""target"": [{""source"": ""https://peerj.com/articles/4375/"", ""selector"": [{""type"": ""FragmentSelector"", ""value"": ""acknowledgements"", ""conformsTo"": ""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3236""}, {""startContainer"": ""/div[3]/div[3]/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/article[1]/footer[1]/section[1]/p[1]"", ""endContainer"": ""/div[3]/div[3]/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/article[1]/footer[1]/section[1]/p[1]"", ""endOffset"": 221, ""type"": ""RangeSelector"", ""startOffset"": 143}, {""type"": ""TextPositionSelector"", ""start"": 79107, ""end"": 79185}, {""type"": ""TextQuoteSelector"", ""suffix"": ""\n      \n      \n         Addition"", ""exact"": ""The author order of JP and HP was determined by coin flip, as is their custom."", ""prefix"": ""nts on a draft of this article.
